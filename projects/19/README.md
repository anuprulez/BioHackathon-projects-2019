# Updating the Galaksio workflow management interface for Galaxy and migrating it to Vue.js

**Project Number:** 19

## Research area alignment

- Galaxy Working Group
 (making bioinformatics more accessible for biologists)

You can find the code here: https://github.com/SGBC/galaksio
It will be merged here properly when I got my computer.

## Team

**Submitter:** Tomas Klingstr√∂m

### Lead(s)

- Tomas Klingstrom

## Expected outcomes

- The overall objective is to provide a simplified interface for running best practice workflows hosted on Galaxy servers. Specifically the hackaton will:
 *Migrate Galaksio to a more sustainable codebase.
 *Bring together key skills necessary to finalize some specific issues in the code.
 *Contribute to creation of a "component library" in Vue as components can be shared between Galaxy, Galaksio and other bioinformatics software using Vue.js (or where Vue.js can be easily added).

## Expected audience

- Galaxy administrators, developers and high level users.
 Researchers knowledgeable in JavaScript (more specifically Vue.js and/or Angular.js).

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
